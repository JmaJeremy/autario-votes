Orillia is my home. 

I was born and raised here. In the winter I played hockey and in the summer I flipped hamburgers at Weber’s. Those experiences taught me the value of teamwork, commitment, and trust.

I graduated from Park Street Collegiate and Trent University.

I am a Chartered Professional Accountant.

For generations my family has worked towards making Orillia a better place. Both of my parents served as mayors of Orillia and taught me the importance of public service. My commitment to this community, that I cherish, is part of my DNA.

Some of my career was spent in the U.S., helping struggling companies became financially viable but most importantly saved thousands of jobs.

I am a proven, trusted leader with decades of real world experience; ready to commit my passion, dedication and experience to being the best possible Mayor as our city grows and changes in the critical years ahead.

As your Mayor, I am committed to improving the quality of life and wellbeing for ALL of the people. I want to create a safe, inclusive, sustainable community that values openness, community engagement and meaningful partnerships. I believe that often solutions to our problems lie within our community.

I will be focused on the things that matter the most to you such as finding a doctor, accessing affordable housing and mitigating the rising cost of living. Finding working solutions for the homelessness, the opioid crisis or mental health is a priority. I am committed to protecting our natural beauty, improving our roads and managing our limited resources wisely. 

I am always ready to listen and look forward to hearing your ideas and concerns.

My wife Cindi and I are looking forward to meeting each and every one of you in the future.
