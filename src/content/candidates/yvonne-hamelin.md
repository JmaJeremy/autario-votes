I have served my community as a Town Councillor (2018 to 2022), Chair of the Development and Operations Committee and Vice Chair of the Regional Physician Recruitment Committee.

As Mayor, my priorities include: increasing affordable housing for people who work in Collingwood, ensuring respectful development, and creating a sustainable and livable Town for our residents. I would like to enhance communications, including increasing opportunities for residents to hear about things Council are discussing and to ask questions about matters that mean the most to them.

Prior to being elected, I practiced as a senior lawyer in the municipal law field for 27 years and chaired the Canadian Property Tax Association.
